When this command is called, then look in tasks.md, then start creating the top task (marked by ### in the markdown file) and its subtasks. 
You should create a new feature_branch and not do the development directly on main.

When the task has been created, then give a summary of the work done.

If the top task has already been created, inform the user of this, and do nothing. 

DO NOT MARK THE TASK AS COMPLETED IN TASKS.MD UNTIL THE USER SAYS SO!
