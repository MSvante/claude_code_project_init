Use the Task tool to activate the project-manager agent to analyze the next task from docs/tasks.md.

The project-manager will:
1. Read and analyze the next task requirements from docs/tasks.md
2. Determine which specialized agents should work on different aspects of the task
3. Coordinate the work across multiple agents as needed
4. Track progress and compile results

IMPORTANT: Let the project-manager make all decisions about which agents to use - do NOT pre-select agents yourself.

All new work should be done on branches that are not main.
